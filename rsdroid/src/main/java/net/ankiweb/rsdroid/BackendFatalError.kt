/** A Java implementation of a rust "panic".
 *
 * rsdroid-bridge is not yet unwind-safe. If a panic occurs, we may be in an incoherent state
 *
 * But, we don't want the rust to panic. This causes a native exception, which will kill AnkiDroid
 * before ACRA can send an exception report to the crash reporting server.
 *
 * This error delays the panic in a form that ACRA can catch, log, then crash more gracefully with.
