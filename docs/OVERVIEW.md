# Overview

Anki-Android-Backend uses Rust, Java and a little Python. Since setting up a Rust environment is somewhat complex, having a separate library encourages drive-by contributions to the main app by keeping a low barrier to entry for Anki-Android.

This repo is comprised of two main components:

- `rslib-bridge` is a small Rust project that gets compiled into a shared library, which Java code can import. Its API consists
  of only three different functions: `openBackend()`, `closeBackend()`, and `runMethodRaw()`. When one of these functions is called by
  Java code, `rslib-bridge` takes care of converting the Java objects to a native Rust representation, and then passes the call
  on to Anki's Rust backend, which gets included in `rslib-bridge` via the `rslib-bridge/anki[/rslib]` submodule.
- `rsdroid` is a Kotlin library that provides a friendly interface to the backend code. The bulk of its code is automatically
  generated from the service definitions in `rslib-bridge/anki/proto/anki`. `rsdroid` also provides an adaptor to the Rust
  database functionality, so that the Rust backend can be used in place of the standard Android SQLite library.

## Protocol Buffers

The Rust backend uses Protocol Buffers to define available methods,
and the structure of data each method takes and receives. The files can
be found in `rslib-bridge/anki/proto/anki`.

For example:

```
service StatsService {
  rpc GetGraphPreferences(generic.Empty) returns (GraphPreferences);
}
...
message GraphPreferences {
  enum Weekday {
    SUNDAY = 0;
    MONDAY = 1;
    FRIDAY = 5;
    SATURDAY = 6;
  }
  Weekday calendar_first_day_of_week = 1;
  bool card_counts_separate_inactive = 2;
  bool browser_links_supported = 3;
  bool future_due_show_backlog = 4;
}
```

Every method takes a _request_ structure, and returns a _response_ structure.
In the case of GetGraphPreferences, which doesn't need any input arguments,
we use the _Empty_ structure which is a message that contains no fields.

When Java code wants to invoke a method on the backend, it first creates the
input request, and then encodes it into a ByteArray. It passes the method
id and the input bytes into the backend's `runMethodRaw()`, and the backend
returns another ByteArray which can be decoded into the output message.

Doing this manually for each method would be a pain, so we use code generation
instead. `tools/protoc-gen/protoc-gen.py` reads the Protobuf files, and
automatically generates methods for us into a GeneratedBackend.kt file. Eg:

```
    @Throws(BackendException::class)
    fun getGraphPreferencesRaw(input: ByteArray): ByteArray {
        return runMethodRaw(service=10, method=2, input);
    }

    @Throws(BackendException::class)
    open fun getGraphPreferences(): anki.stats.GraphPreferences {
        val builder = anki.generic.Empty.newBuilder();
        val input = builder.build();
        return anki.stats.GraphPreferences.parseFrom(
                getGraphPreferencesRaw(input.toByteArray()));
    }
```

## Backend

The main class that AnkiDroid uses is called `Backend`. It includes:

- all the generated method definitions from `GeneratedBackend.kt`
- a `tr` property that exposes all the backend translations
- helper methods for DB access

When `Backend` is instantiated, it uses `NativeMethods.kt:openBackend()` to
create a handle to a backend instance. `Backend.close()` takes care of
also closing the backend instance, closing the collection if open, and
freeing up memory.

Each backend instance supports a single open collection, so multiple
backend instances need to be created if you need to have multiple collections
open in parallel. Switching between collections does not require multiple
instances - you can close one collection and then open another with the
same backend instance.

`Backend` also wraps the majority of method calls in a mutex, which prevents
any backend call from being made while a transaction is active on another
thread.

## BackendFactory

`BackendFactory.getBackend()` is used by AnkiDroid to get a `Backend` instance
with translations set to the language currently configured by the user.

The returned backend has a boolean legacySchema property, which is
set to `BackendFactory.defaultLegacySchema`.

When set to the default of true, collections are not upgraded on opening,
and they remain in the legacy schema 11 format that AnkiDroid's legacy
code expects. Many backend methods require the schema to be updated, so
when this setting is enabled, the backend can effectively only be used
for DB access, and a few routines that do not require an open collection
to operate.

When set to false, collections are upgraded to the latest schema on opening,
allowing full use of backend functionality. This setting has not received
much testing yet. To change it, see TESTING.md

## Error handling

The API `rslib-bridge` exposes is defined in `rsdroid`'s NativeMethods.kt:

```
    external fun runMethodRaw(backendPointer: Long, service: Int, method: Int, args: ByteArray): Array<ByteArray?>?
    external fun openBackend(data: ByteArray): Array<ByteArray?>?
    external fun closeBackend(backendPointer: Long)
```

When the backend returns data, it needs to be able to return either the data,
or an error message. This is done with nested arrays: `Array<ByteArray?>?` is
`[valid_data_or_null, error_data_or_null]`. The `Backend` class takes care of
this for us, extracting the error message, decoding it into a protobuf message and
then a native BackendException, and throwing it. The outer array is declared
as nullable to account for rare cases where an array can't be allocated.

## Usage in AnkiDroid

When a collection is opened with `Storage.collection()`, a `Backend` instance
is created (or reused if provided), and stored in `Collection.backend`. As
`Collection` is initialized, it calls `Storage.openDB(path, backend)` which
creates a `DB` instance that delegates database calls to the provided backend.

If `defaultLegacySchema` is false, a `CollectionV16` subclass of `Collection`
is returned instead. It contains changes to work with the new backend methods,
such as requesting a list of decks from the backend instead of directly trying
to query them via SQL, eg:

```
    override fun all_names_and_ids(skip_empty_default: Boolean, include_filtered: Boolean): List<DeckNameId> {
        return backend.getDeckNames(skip_empty_default, include_filtered).map {
                entry ->
            DeckNameId(entry.name, entry.id)
        }
    }
```

V16 corresponds to the schema version that was current when this code was originally
written, and is not technically correct anymore. The DecksV16/ModelsV16/etc classes
also use a few layers of indirection, as they were written at a time when it wasn't
clear whether AnkiDroid would be using the Rust backend or not.

## Usage in unit tests

AnkiDroid's unit tests run with Robolectric, and to use the backend inside Robolectric, a separate build of rslib-bridge is required. This is handled
by `rsdroid-testing`, which takes care of compiling `rslib-bridge` correctly,
and provides a `RustBackendLoader.kt` file which AnkiDroid's unit tests call
into.

## Database Access

We need to use the Rust for database access as:

- We need an open collection to perform most commands in rslib
- An open collection obtains a lock on the database - access can only be made through the Rust.

So, we implement `SupportSQLiteOpenHelper.Factory` and related classes.

### Memory Pressure

Anki's rust code does not stream database results, all results are currently obtained without streaming and are temporarily stored in memory in the Rust.

This is not a significant problem, as:

- Rust is not confined by the Java heap limit
- Most results are small
- In time, we will move most data processing to the Rust, removing the need to deserialize data
- Java has been converted to use protobuf serialization (vs Anki Desktop using JSON), this significantly reduces memory usage.

#### LimitOffsetSQLiteCursor

If the above is not sufficient, work could be performed to make `LimitOffsetSQLiteCursor` work.

#### Streaming over JNI

Over the JNI boundary, streaming takes place via `StreamingProtobufSQLiteCursor`

**Caveat**: Nested streamed queries cannot currently take place using this method due to the Rust implementation via a HashMap (ensuring that memory will not be leaked by non-disposed result sets). An exception will occur if nested queries are detected, and this constraint will be revisited.

## Panics

Rust panics (excluding OutOfMemory) are serialized to an `BackendError` proto, and sent to the Java.

`BackendException.fromError` will convert this to a `BackendFatalError`. ACRA cannot pick up on a native crash, by converting it into an Error, we can get a stack trace.

## Publishing

Artifacts are published to Sonatype OSS via CI. This is a Maven repository. `VERSION_NAME` inside `gradle.properties` defines the version number
