/**
 * This interface defines a set of functions that are not available on all platforms.
 *
 *
 * A set of implementations for the supported platforms are available.
 *
 *
 * Each implementation ends with a `V<n>` prefix, identifying the minimum API version on which this implementation
 * can be used. For example, see [CompatV16].
 *
 *
 * Each implementation should extend the previous implementation and implement this interface.
 *
 *
 * Each implementation should only override the methods that first become available in its own version, use @Override.
 *
 *
 * Methods not supported by its API will default to the empty implementations of CompatV8.  Methods first supported
 * by lower APIs will default to those implementations since we extended them.
 *
 *
 * Example: CompatV21 extends CompatV19. This means that the setSelectableBackground function using APIs only available
 * in API 21, should be implemented properly in CompatV19 with @Override annotation. On the other hand a method
 * like showViewWithAnimation that first becomes available in API 19 need not be implemented again in CompatV21,
 * unless the behaviour is supposed to be different there.
